    "Our plan for this project:\n",
    " - Download SP500 stocks prices data\n",
    " - Calculate different technical indicators and features for each stock \n",
    " - Aggregate monthly and filter only top 150 most liquid stocks for each month\n",
    " - Calculate monthly returns for different time horizons \n",
    " - Use Fama-French Factors to calculate rolling betas for each stock \n",
    " - Train a K-Means model for each month to cluster similar stocks together\n",
    " - For each month, select assets based on a cluster and form a portfolio using Efficient Frontier max sharpe ratio portfolio optimisation \n",
    " - Visualise portfolio returns and compare with SP500 \n",
    "\n",
    "=> LIMITATION: We are using only the most recent SP500 stocks list and therefore suffer from the surviviorship bias. We should use surviviorship free data. "
